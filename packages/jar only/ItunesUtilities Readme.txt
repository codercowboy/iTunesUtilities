Usage Instructions
------------------

[Step 1: Load your iTunes library]
iPlaylist Copier will attempt to autodetect your iTunes library file, but if it cannot automatically locate your library file, or you wish to specify another library file, then you need to locate the library file by clicking the "Browse" button in the "iTunes Library Location" box.

[Step 2: Select the playlist to copy]
After the library is loaded, the drop down selector in the "Playlist" box will be populated and become selectable. Select the playlist you want copy by selecting it in the drop down selector.


[Optional Step 3: Specify a track name format]
Next, you can specify a desired filename naming scheme by typing your desired format into the "Track Name Format" box. iPlaylist Copier does not currently support creating folders, so slashes (/ or \) in the format will be ignored. 

[Step 4: Copy Files]
The "Copy Files" button will become enabled after you have loaded your iTunes library and selected your desired playlist. 

Click the "Copy Files" button and select the folder you want iPlaylist Copier to put your exported media files in.
